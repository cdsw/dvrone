DVrone is a prototype solution that aims to offer the ability to control a drone unit by using rotational sensory input from a display attached to the operatorâ€™s head.

DVrone was developed for people with disabilities in mind. We considered the difficulties one could face in drone control without complete sensory or motor capabilities of the body, and transformed that into a prototype offering drone control capabilities with the least amount of variation in required sensory input.

People with limited sensory or motor capabilities may find it extremely hard, if not impossible, to perform complex tasks such as drone control. People who suffer from lower-body paralysation may find the task completely impossible without the aid of tools designed to provide accessibility.

Our solution aims to address the problem by offering a means to perform drone control by, in its most minimal form, only using neck/head rotation. This allows people who are paralysed below their upper torso, as well as people with other sensory limitations such as deafness to be able to control drones.
